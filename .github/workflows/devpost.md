# What it does
**_MoneyNext_** is a tool that aims to target the financial independence and personal growth aspect of the prompt that was given to us in Calgary Hacks; by serving as a **mobile financial consultant** which helps you make descisions based on your monthly expenditure. 

It not only helps a student track his/her expenses through our easy to use UI/UX, but it also budgets your expenses accordingly and presents forward tailored solutions based on their monthly spending in order to help money grow and work for you. It uses generative artificial intelligence to make personalized reccomendations to allieviate the financial  burdens of students. 

## Inspiration
Many currentor future university students like ourselves and many others constantly struggle with their finances. Whats troubling is that we, and many others do not understand how to budget our earning properly and even if we do, we do not have the skills for it to grow. 

For such a tangible issue, we made a tool which not only helps you track your expenses and budget it efficiently: it also serves as your robo-business consultant tailored to meet your needs. Such a tool is very necessary in this day and age, so that students such as ourselves dont spend all of their savings on the new upcoming trends. But instead spend it wisely on the things that they actually need.

# How we built it
Given the immaturity of our skills, we practically bootstrapped the entire project and learned each and every skill to wing the best we can. 

The frontend of the project is built on React, a Javascript library, It also uses Tailwind in order to make the website look aesthetically pleasing. Moreover, in order to produce solutions that are tailor-made for students, we use Gemini API in order produce generative AI responses within our website. 

## Challenges we ran into
A prevalent challenge amongst our group members were the gaps in our collective knowledge, as well as the languages we were capable of coding in. For the majority of our group, this was their first hackathon, posessing little to no skills whatsoever. To add onto that, we were not able to execute the XGBoost model due to data problems intially, so we thought on our feet and came up with a cranked version for our project. For the duration of 24 hours we hustled to learn new frameworks such as react and some complex machine learning models and working with APIs. Debugging and testing was one of the few challenges which created roadblocks for us. Moreover, putting all of the newly learned skills together into a pipeline which produces an end result was a challenging task as well. Despite these challenges, we managed to bootstrap an end product which we are proud about. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the fact that we completed the project in time and that we were able to come to a consensus despite our knowledge disparities . We are also proud that we have inculcated completely new skills into our feathers. Teamwork and efficient communication skills with collaboration are some soft skills that we have picked up through this hackathon which will help us excell at a bigger stage. 

## What we learned
Firstly, we have learned a lot about different javascript libraries such as react, node js, next js, tailwind. On top of that we also learnt about different types of Machine learning Models such as XgBoost and CNNs. Secondly, we also picked up essential skills of teamwork and communication alongside collaboration and willpower which propells us to complete our goals. Through this hackathon, we have realized that it is essential to think on your feet and not let a roadblock stop you. 

## What's next for MoneyNext
We aim to keep working with MoneyNext and make improvements to its UI/UX. Secondly we also aim to backtrack and succesfully train our machine learning model based on xgboost in order for it to read csv files and make financial descisions based on that, which will not only make it more efficient but also more tailored towards the needs of the customer. Thirdly we aim to use AWS within the backend to make it more secure and then venture onto connecting banking information within the website.
